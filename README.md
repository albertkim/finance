Finance
=======

A platform for non-professional investors to track their portfolios as efficiently as possible.
The design philosophy is to present the bare essentials that someone would want to know about their portfolio or stock watchlist. Options to see advanced statistics will be given, but will not be presented as part of the main view.
Simplicity is the key focus of this project.
